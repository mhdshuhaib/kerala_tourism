Shankumugham Beach is a beach in Thiruvananthapuram district of Kerala, south India. The vast stretch of white sand and the serene atmosphere, away from the crowd in the city, provide all the ingredients for relaxation and for spending an ideal evening. There is also a “Star Fish Restaurant” with eating kiosks and open-air theatre with car parking facilities. Good food can be enjoyed at the Old Coffee House, just across the beach, which is also a vantage point for enjoying the sunset. Unfortunately, the beach is not well maintained with garbage littering the entire area

Shanghumugham beach is considered as the ‘Arattukadavu’ of Sri Ananthapadmanabhan – The presiding deity of the city. Thousands of Hindus perform ‘Bali Tharpanam’ during special occasions. Shanghu mugham is the prime location for Ganesh Nimarjan at the time of Vinayaka Chathurthi.
